Storage backends:
- Local filesystem:
  self.save_dirname = "{config_job.path_local}/checkpoints"

- S3 object store:
  self.save_dirname = "s3://{bucket}/{config_job.path}/checkpoints"
  where bucket = self.config_checkpoint.save_to_object_store.bucket

The sharded format enables efficient distributed saving/loading by:
1. Parallelizing I/O across processes
2. Reducing memory usage per process
3. Supporting both local and cloud storage backends

    """
    CustomLoadPlanner that supports ignoring keys during checkpoint load.
    This is useful when the checkpoint is saved with a different component
    architecture, e.g. different RoPE embeddings than the current model.

    Setting ``keys_to_skip_loading``: do not construct this planner directly. Set the experiment's
    checkpoint config field ``checkpoint.keys_to_skip_loading`` (a ``list[str]``; see
    :class:`cosmos_framework.utils.config.CheckpointConfig`) and the checkpointer forwards it here. Each entry is
    matched as a *substring* against every flattened fully-qualified name in the model/optimizer state
    dict, and any leaf whose fqn contains one of the entries is skipped. The list is only honored on a
    warm start (loading from a *different* run via ``checkpoint.load_path``); when resuming the latest
    checkpoint of the same run it is forced to ``[]``, since there is nothing to skip. Examples:

    1. Skip a reshaped positional embedding (different sequence length) for reg + EMA copies.
       checkpoint.keys_to_skip_loading=["net.latent_pos_embed.seq", "net_ema.latent_pos_embed.seq"]
    2. Skip action-head layers when warm-starting an action model from a non-action checkpoint.
       checkpoint.keys_to_skip_loading=["action2llm", "llm2action", "action_modality_embed", "action_pos_embed"]

    When ``dedup=True`` it additionally elects a single reader per replicated leaf to kill
    redundant storage reads. Two replication patterns waste reads at large world sizes:

    1. Fully-replicated leaves (e.g. optimizer scalar ``step`` tensors, replicated buffers) are
       saved on global rank 0 but appear in *every* rank's state dict, so all ``world_size`` ranks
       read the same object — a single-object hotspot.
    2. HSDP shards are identical across the ``dp_replicate`` dim, so each shard file is read by
       ``dp_replicate`` ranks.

    With ``dedup=True``, ``create_local_plan`` drops, from the read plan it builds, the items this
    rank is *not* the designated reader for, so each leaf is fetched from storage exactly once.

    ``create_local_plan`` always builds the read plan by calling ``create_default_local_load_plan``
    directly on ``self._skip_keys_if_found(self.state_dict)`` rather than delegating to
    ``super().create_local_plan()``. This serves two ends:

    1. It drops ``keys_to_skip_loading`` *before* plan construction, so skipped keys never reach the
       base helper's strict missing-key validation or its *unconditional* size-mismatch check.
       Skipping therefore works with ``strict_resume=True``, with a skipped key absent from the
       checkpoint, and with a skipped key present-but-reshaped (e.g. different RoPE embeddings).
    2. It avoids the base ``create_local_plan``'s pre-2.4 "missing keys" fallback, which would
       re-derive ``self.state_dict`` from the full ``original_state_dict`` and reinstate any skipped
       key still present in the checkpoint. Dropping that fallback is acceptable -- this repo does
       not load pre-2.4 checkpoints.

    ``self.state_dict`` is never mutated (``_skip_keys_if_found`` returns a pruned *copy*, or the dict
    unchanged when nothing matches), so the loader still writes non-tensor leaves back into the caller's
    state dict in place.

    Dedup removes reads at a different point: ``create_local_plan`` filters the already-built plan's
    read items via ``_drop_non_reader_items``, looking each leaf up in the full ``self.state_dict``.

    - ``DTensor`` leaf -> reader is local rank 0 along the tensor's replicate mesh dim (one reader
      per replicate group; a fully-sharded tensor has none, so every rank reads its own shard);
    - non-``DTensor`` leaf (plain tensor / python scalar) -> fully replicated across the world, so
      the reader is global rank 0.

    Reading the replicate dim from each tensor's *own* mesh (rather than one global ``dp_replicate``
    group) generalizes to tensors on different meshes, e.g. MoE expert weights under expert
    parallelism. The dropped data is filled in afterwards by :func:`_broadcast_state_dict`.
    Because each rank then reads a disjoint subset, dedup requires ``no_dist=True`` (there is no
    global plan to coordinate).

    A ``DTensor``'s local shard is byte-identical across every mesh dim whose placement is
    ``Replicate()``; it differs along ``Shard``/``Partial`` dims. Reading those dims' data once and
    broadcasting along them is therefore lossless. Deriving this from the tensor's *own* mesh (not a
    single global ``dp_replicate`` group) is what lets the dedup generalize to tensors on other
    meshes — e.g. MoE expert weights on a future expert-parallel mesh whose replicate dim differs.

    Mesh dims of **size 1** are excluded: they carry no replication, and — critically — every rank
    is local rank 0 along a size-1 dim, so treating one as a replicate dim would make the
    single-reader election (see :func:`_is_assigned_reader`) pass on *every* rank
    and silently disable dedup along the real replicate dim. This is exactly the failure for a
    fully-replicated leaf (e.g. an optimizer ``step`` with ``[Replicate(), Replicate()]``) on the
    2-D ``(dp_replicate=1, dp_shard=N)`` FSDP mesh: without this filter the size-1 ``dp_replicate``
    dim is picked, so all ``N`` ranks read the single object in ``__0_0.distcp`` instead of just
    global rank 0.

    Returns multiple dims for a leaf replicated across several mesh dims (e.g. a fully-replicated
    tensor on an HSDP ``(dp_replicate>1, dp_shard)`` mesh); empty when the tensor is fully sharded

        A save is only confirmed once its result is taken off the queue, and that is what
        dispatches ``on_save_checkpoint_success`` -- which drives OneLogger's
        ``train_iterations_productive_end`` and lets wall-clock retention advance. Left to
        :meth:`_wait_for_previous_async_checkpoint` alone, the confirmation waits for the
        *next* save to drain this one, or for :meth:`finalize` on a graceful exit. A job
        killed abnormally in between -- preemption, cancellation, timeout, node failure --
        therefore threw away credit for a checkpoint that had been durable on disk for as
        long as the gap between saves. Job 1881483 wrote iteration 58500 successfully at
        10:52:04 and was preempted at 11:32:56 having reached 58856, yet still reported
        58000 as its last productive iteration.

        Polling once per optimizer step narrows that window to the write itself plus one
        iteration.

        Unlike the blocking wait, this never adjudicates a result that has not arrived: an
        empty queue means the write is still running, and a queue that cannot be read is
        left to the blocking wait at the next save, which has the timeout needed to tell a
        slow save from a dead background process.

        Nor does it ever end the job -- only success is acted on here. Every rank runs its
        own background writer and reads its own queue, so a failed save surfaces at a
        different step on each rank, and a rank that raised while its peers were still
        writing would drop out of the next collective and hang them rather than bring the
        job down coherently. The writers' own process group tolerates a stalled save for
        ``BACKGROUND_SAVE_TIMEOUT``, so the spread between two ranks' results can be most
        of an hour. A failure is therefore logged here for promptness and left in
        ``deferred_save_failure`` for :meth:`_wait_for_previous_async_checkpoint`, which
        every rank reaches together at the next save or at :meth:`finalize` -- the same
        place, and the same iteration, as before this poll existed.
