"""Callback that saves extra checkpoints on a wall-clock schedule.

Motivation
----------

``checkpoint.save_iter`` bounds checkpoint spacing in *iterations*, which
translates to a wildly varying amount of wall-clock time depending on model
size, resolution and node count.  This callback adds a second, time-based
trigger so that no more than ``interval_minutes`` of training is ever lost,
independent of how slow an iteration happens to be.  It supplements rather
than replaces ``save_iter``: whichever comes first wins.

Rank agreement
--------------

DCP saves are collective, so every rank must reach the same conclusion on
every step.  Each rank's own clock drifts, so comparing per-rank elapsed time
would eventually let ranks disagree and deadlock the job.  Rank 0 therefore
owns the timer and broadcasts its decision.

That collective is throttled to at most every ``check_every_n`` iterations,
but the stride shrinks as the deadline approaches: rank 0 divides the time
still owed by its measured step time and broadcasts the result, so a job at
minutes per iteration ends up checking every step rather than sailing hours
past the interval.  What remains is normally a one-iteration overshoot, because
a checkpoint can only be taken at a step boundary.  With context parallelism,
the save may wait a few more steps until the trainer reaches the next CP
data-window boundary, so dataloader sampler state is checkpointed safely.

What the interval bounds
-----------------------

The clock starts when a save *starts*, not when it lands, so the interval bounds
how often a save is *initiated*: at most ``interval_minutes`` plus the iteration
in flight.  Durability lags that by however long the background write takes, and
that lag adds to work lost in a crash -- a save begun at minute 30 and still
writing when the job dies leaves the previous checkpoint as the resume point.
The lag is not charged against the cadence, though: ``on_save_checkpoint_success``
deliberately does not touch the timer, so a slow write cannot push the next save
further out.

Waiting for durability instead would mean blocking the training step on the write,
which is what asynchronous checkpointing exists to avoid.  What is guaranteed is
that writes never overlap: ``save()`` opens by waiting out the previous async
write, so a save triggered while one is still in flight -- during a filesystem
outage, say -- stalls the step rather than starting a second concurrent write, and
a previous write that failed ends the job there.

Yielding to a nearby milestone
------------------------------

That serialization is why this callback also has to look ahead.  A wall-clock save
started shortly before a ``save_iter`` milestone does not just duplicate it: the
milestone's save blocks until our write drains, and the training step blocks with
it.  On GCP at 470B, a write begun 3.5 minutes before a milestone ran for 844
seconds and stalled the job for ten of them, and because the two cadences were
within a few minutes of each other it recurred on nearly every cycle.

So a save is skipped when the next milestone is projected to arrive sooner than a
write takes.  Yielding costs only the time left until that milestone, which is
about to checkpoint regardless, whereas going ahead costs a stall -- so the write
estimate is deliberately pessimistic in both directions it can be wrong.

It is the larger of ``assumed_write_minutes`` and the slowest write in a short
recent window, never an average.  An average is the wrong statistic for a guard
whose entire purpose is to avoid a tail event: the run above wrote in 84s and in
844s within the same hour, and anything centred between the two clears a
five-minute gap that the slow write would then stall for nine minutes.  The
assumed floor covers the case where nothing has been measured yet, which is not
an edge case -- a duration is only known once a write of this process has landed,
so the first wall-clock decision after a start or resume has no sample at all, and
on a preempted job that first cycle comes around often.

The consequence is worth stating plainly: a job whose milestones are closer
together than roughly the interval plus the assumed write time will run on its
milestone cadence, because every wall-clock save yields.  That is the intended
trade -- those jobs are already checkpointing about as often as this callback
would have made them.

Retention
---------

Extra checkpoints would otherwise pile up in the experiments bucket, so this
callback prunes its own saves down to the last ``keep_last``.  It only ever
deletes checkpoints it created (identified by a marker object it writes) and
never a ``save_iter`` milestone, so tooling that assumes checkpoints persist
-- periodic generation, evaluations pinned to an iteration, retroactive
promotion to the permanent bucket -- is unaffected.

Deletion is asynchronous out of necessity, not as an optimization.
``on_save_checkpoint_success`` is dispatched on the main thread -- by the
checkpointer's per-step poll of the background writer, or by the blocking
drain at the top of the next ``save()``, whichever reaches the finished write
first -- so any blocking work there stalls the training step.  Removing a
checkpoint means thousands of individual object deletions, so it is handed to
a background thread on rank 0.

Because that thread is a daemon, an interpreter exit can abandon a deletion
midway.  A ``.deleting`` marker is therefore written before the first object
is removed, and any checkpoint carrying it is re-queued on the next startup,
which makes deletion idempotent and resumable rather than leaving a partial
directory behind forever.

Completeness
------------

Retention would otherwise delete on the strength of a *reported* success:
``on_save_checkpoint_success`` fires when the background writer says it is
done, and nothing else in the checkpoint path ever reads a checkpoint back to
confirm it is loadable.  Had the object store silently truncated a write the
writer believed it completed, pruning would discard a good checkpoint in
favour of a bad one.

So before an expired checkpoint is removed, the checkpoint that displaced it
is checked two ways.  First, each component must have its ``.metadata``, which
DCP writes only once that component's shards are all in.  Second, every shard
must be at least as long as that metadata says it is: ``storage_data`` records
a file, an offset and a length for every shard written, so the high-water mark
of ``offset + length`` is the last byte the writer claims to have put in each
file, and a ``HEAD`` gives the byte count actually stored.  A failed check
defers the deletion rather than cancelling it: the retained window grows by one
instead of advancing over a checkpoint that may not load, and the next prune
retries.

A ``.metadata`` that will not parse defers too.  It was written by the same DCP
runtime minutes earlier, so it cannot plausibly be a format from the future,
and a corrupt or truncated one is exactly the damage being looked for.

The second check is what covers a shard whose write stopped partway.  The first
cannot see that, because ``.metadata`` is a separate, later object -- its
presence says the writer got to the end of the component, not that every byte
before it arrived.

Neither check reads shard contents, so neither can see corruption *within* a
shard: bytes that are present and the right length but wrong.  Detecting that
would mean reading every byte back on every save, and it would buy little here.
A digest computed while writing cannot catch a source buffer that was already
wrong, TLS covers the wire, and the object store checksums its own bytes at
rest.  Truncation is the failure mode left over, and it is the one this sees.

The cost is one ``HEAD`` per shard plus the metadata read itself, on the rank-0
deletion thread, so the training step pays nothing for it.  The metadata read is
the only part that is not negligible: ``storage_data`` carries an entry per
shard, so on the largest configurations that object is big enough to be worth
watching.
