    Params are grouped by their ``device_mesh`` (using mesh-dim-names as the

    L2 norm per mesh group (reducing any DTensor result via ``.full_tensor()``)
    and combines the per-mesh scalars into ONE global norm via
    ``sqrt(sum(per_mesh_norm**2))``, then ``_clip_grads_with_global_norm``
    scales the gradients by ``min(1, clip_norm / global_norm)``, passing every
    mesh group that same global scalar — a SINGLE GLOBAL rescale across every
    parameter.

    This is necessary for correctness when parameters live on multiple device
    meshes (e.g. dense FSDP-shard + EP-shard MoE experts): clipping each
    mesh independently with stock ``torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_`` would
    assign a different rescale factor per mesh and distort the relative
    magnitudes of dense vs MoE updates. Under VFM's current FSDP-only
    setup the math reduces to a single mesh group and is identical to
    stock ``clip_grad_norm_``; this implementation is forward-correct
    once EP is enabled.

    For diagnostics, the callback ALSO records pre-clip per-mesh sub-norms
    alongside the actual global norm. When ``track_per_modality=True`` (VFM),
    samples are bucketed by image/video via ``model.is_image_batch(data_batch)``,
    producing wandb keys ``clip_grad_norm/{image|video}/{mesh_key}`` plus a
    ``.../global`` synthetic key carrying the actual rescale norm. When False
    (VLM), keys are ``clip_grad_norm/{mesh_key}`` plus ``clip_grad_norm/global``.

    Param-source semantics:
      * ``track_per_modality=True`` (VFM): caller passes the ``OmniMoTModel``;
        only ``model.net.parameters()`` is iterated, matching legacy VFM
        behavior (the optimizer is built from ``self.net``).
      * ``track_per_modality=False`` (VLM): caller passes a single
        ``ImaginaireModel`` or a list of model parts; ``parameters()`` is
        iterated and filtered by grad-presence.

    Args:
      clip_norm: max norm to clip to.
      force_finite: if True, NaN/Inf in any grad is zeroed in-place and the
        norm re-measured, on the steps where the computed norm comes back
        non-finite (which is exactly the steps where some grad entry is).
      track_per_modality: if True, route stats into image/video buckets via
