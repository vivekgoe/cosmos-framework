#   LiDAR sweep, which fuses the whole rig rather than looking through one camera.

# confined to a single ``(frame, view)`` cell -- so this is the choice that sets what the mask
# costs. For a sample of ``V`` views by ``F`` frames per view by ``S`` spatial tokens per cell,
# that quadrant holds ``(V*F*S)**2`` pairs, of which each scope keeps:
#
# * ``"all_views"``: all of them. Every camera sees every other one at every instant. This is
#   the default. Cost is (FVS)^2.
# * ``"same_view"``: ``1/V`` of them. Each camera only attends to its own noisy tokens. Cost
#   is V*(FS)^2.
# * ``"decomposed"``: Each camera attends to its own noisy tokens plus the same frame in
#   every other camera, which decomposes the square into a temporal half and a spatial one.
#   Cost is V*(FS)^2 + F*(VS)^2. Rejected on a joint camera + LiDAR pack unless
#   ``decomposed_temporal_window_seconds`` is set: the two streams do not share a frame
#   index, but they do share real capture time, which the window compares instead.

# and does not take a scope -- see ``BackendPreference``.

# * ``"maskless"``: the maskless three-pass decomposition -- same view across all frames, same
#   frame across all views, and gen->und -- merged by log-sum-exp, with no mask anywhere. See
#   ``models.mot.multiview_maskless_attention.multiview_maskless_gen_attention``.
# * ``"flex_flash"``: the masked FlexAttention call on FlashAttention-4 (CuTeDSL) kernels.
# * ``"flex_triton"``: the same masked call on FlexAttention's Triton kernels. Available by
#   construction, so it is what everything else falls back to.
# * ``"auto"``: ``"flex_flash"`` where FA4 is available, else ``"flex_triton"``. The folds
#   rank last and are never reached, Triton always resolving, which is what keeps "auto" a
#   choice of kernels rather than of attention. ``"maskless"`` is opt-in, by name.
#
# ``"maskless"`` is NOT a faster spelling of ``mask.attention_scope="decomposed"``: its two sensor
# passes overlap on the query's own ``(view, frame)`` cell, and merging double-weights it where
# the mask counts it once -- measured ~22% apart on a small sample. It is a distinct attention
# pattern, so it is a choice about what to train and not only about how fast to run: a
# checkpoint trained under a mask is not one ``"maskless"`` can serve, and the reverse holds too.
#
# That is why availability here is a property of the *config* rather than of the batch, and why
# a batch the folds cannot express raises instead of quietly taking a mask. Naming ``"maskless"``
# fixes what a run trains for its whole duration. See ``models.mot.multiview_maskless_attention.maskless_unavailable_reason``, which owns
# that verdict because every condition in it is a fact about what the folds express, and
# ``models.mot.multiview_attention.resolve_multiview_backend``, which acts on it.
