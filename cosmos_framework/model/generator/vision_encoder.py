"""Turning a step's raw vision items into latents, optionally balanced across ranks.

:class:`VisionEncoder` owns the whole "collect -> balance -> use" path: it splits vision
items into the individual VAE encode calls they cost, optionally redistributes those calls
across the ``lb`` group so every rank does a comparable share of the work (see
``models/mot/vae_load_balance.py``), and regroups the resulting latents back into one per
item. Callers get identical latents either way; only where each encode ran differs.

It is deliberately a small object over injected collaborators rather than a mixin on the
model. Its whole dependency surface is the four constructor arguments below, which is what
lets it be built and exercised without a real model, a config, or a process group.
