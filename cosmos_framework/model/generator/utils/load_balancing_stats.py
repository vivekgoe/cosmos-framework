    Args:
        routing_probabilities: ``[N,E]`` per-token router probabilities over experts.
        expert_indices: ``[N,K]`` experts selected per token.
        sample_ids: ``[N]`` bucket assignment per token. Every id must lie in
            ``[0, num_samples]`` inclusive -- ``num_samples`` itself is legal and names the
            sentinel below.
        num_samples: how many leading buckets to *retain*, not how many real samples exist.
            This function allocates ``num_samples + 1`` buckets and returns the first
            ``num_samples`` of them, so index ``num_samples`` is a sentinel that is always
            discarded. Callers use it as the drain for tokens that must not reach any statistic
            (padding); see ``Qwen3VLMoeTextSparseMoeBlock.forward``, which redirects masked rows
            there. Retained buckets may legitimately come out empty -- a caller that reserves a
            slot it does not fill -- and ``compute_load_balancing_loss`` drops those via its
            ``sample_num_tokens > 0`` mask rather than this function pruning them, which
            would make the returned shapes data-dependent.
