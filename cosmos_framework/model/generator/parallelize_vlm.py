    Matches ``inner._no_split_modules`` — the decoder layers (+ vision blocks for
    VLMs, e.g. Qwen3-VL ``visual.blocks``). MUST run before any ``fully_shard``
    call: ``fully_shard`` mutates each block's ``__class__`` to a dynamically
    created ``FSDP<OrigName>`` type, after which the typename match finds nothing.
    :func:`apply_ac` replaces each block with a ``CheckpointWrapper``, which also
    defeats the typename match, so this runs exactly ONCE per ``parallelize`` and the
    resulting list is threaded through the later passes.

    ``_no_split_modules`` is unioned over the root AND every submodule, mirroring
    ``PreTrainedModel._get_no_split_modules``. Composite VLMs declare it on the sub-model
    that owns the blocks rather than on the root they are assembled into — Nemotron-3-Dense-VL
    declares it only on its nested ``Siglip2VisionTransformer``, so a root-only lookup would
    find nothing for that family.

    A name match alone is NOT enough to make a module a block. HF's attribute means "never
    split these types across devices under ``device_map``", so a declaration legitimately
    names singletons — embeddings, pooling heads, projectors — beside the repeated layers.
    Treating a singleton as a block is wasted work at best, and ``fully_shard``-ing one breaks
    any parent that reads its parameters outside the child's ``forward``, where FSDP has
    already resharded them. So a match is kept only when it is a child of an ``nn.ModuleList``
    — the shape every supported family uses for its repeated layers, and one that still holds
    for a single-layer config where an "appears more than once" test would collect nothing.

    Owns activation checkpointing for the VLM path, replacing HF's
    ``gradient_checkpointing_enable``. Same strategy as the MoT path
    (``parallelize_unified_mot.apply_ac``): the block is swapped for a
    ``ptd_checkpoint_wrapper`` around itself, re-registered under its original attribute
    name so the module tree keeps its shape.

    Why not HF's API. ``GradientCheckpointingLayer.__call__`` invokes the checkpoint from
    INSIDE the block, so the only place left to hang ``torch.compile`` is
    ``_compiled_call_impl``, i.e. inside the checkpoint. That nesting makes the eager
    checkpoint machinery compare its own saved tensors against a separately-traced
    recompute, tripping ``_CheckpointFrame.check_recomputed_tensors_match`` with
    ``CheckpointError: Recomputed values ... have different metadata``. It surfaced in the
    Qwen3-VL vision blocks (``saved dtype: bfloat16`` vs ``recomputed dtype: float32``),
    where ``apply_rotary_pos_emb_vision`` round-trips q/k through float32 and the two
    tracing contexts disagree about which dtype to save; ``Qwen3VLTextRMSNorm`` has the same
    float32 round-trip shape, so restricting compile to one tower would only relocate it.
    A module wrapper inverts the nesting for free: :func:`apply_compile` compiles the
    WRAPPER, so the ``checkpoint`` call is inside the traced region where Dynamo lowers it
    to the activation-checkpoint higher-order op and the compiler owns forward and recompute
    together (Note: [torch.compile and checkpoint] in ``torch/utils/checkpoint.py``).

    It also puts FSDP2's forward hooks OUTSIDE the checkpoint, since :func:`apply_fsdp`
    shards this wrapper (or the compiled wrapper around it, never the block within).
    HF checkpoints ``__call__`` precisely to keep the hooks inside
    (forcing a re-all-gather on recompute); here the backward pre-hook has already
    re-all-gathered by the time the recompute runs, so the collective is not repeated and
    one fewer opaque region sits inside the compiled graph.

    ``CheckpointWrapper`` is transparent to the checkpoint/resume path: its state_dict hooks
    strip ``_checkpoint_wrapped_module.`` on save and re-add it on load, and
    ``safetensors_loader.load_vlm_model`` strips the same prefix itself.

    Two behaviours HF's ``GradientCheckpointingLayer.__call__`` supplied are dropped, both
    harmless here: its ``self.training`` gate (non-reentrant checkpoint is a passthrough
    when grad is disabled, so eval only pays the wrapper call) and its ``use_cache`` /
    ``past_key_values`` sanitization (``HFModel.forward`` already pins
    ``use_cache=False``).

    ``ptd_checkpoint_wrapper`` defaults to ``CheckpointImpl.NO_REENTRANT``, which the MoE
    load-balancing stash requires: it is a side channel out of the block's forward and only
    stays grad-connected under non-reentrant AC (see
    ``VLMModel.compute_load_balancing_loss``).

    Args:
        model: HFModel whose ``model._no_split_modules`` blocks (decoder layers + vision
               blocks for VLMs) are wrapped in place.
        ac:    AC policy (``VLMModelConfig.activation_checkpointing``).

    Returns:
        The block slots the later passes must operate on — holding the checkpoint wrappers
        when AC is enabled, the original blocks when ``mode == "none"``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: No repeated blocks are discoverable. Checked BEFORE the ``mode == "none"``
                    early return, so it gates every run rather than only AC-enabled ones: the
                    declaration this depends on is the same one :func:`apply_compile` and
                    :func:`apply_fsdp` need, so a run that gets past here uncheckpointed would
                    also be uncompiled and sharded as one flat group. Being the first pass in

    ``slots`` is never empty: :func:`apply_ac` raises on an undiscoverable block set for every
    AC mode before this runs, so there is no silently-uncompiled case left to report here.
    Independent of FSDP (peer of :func:`apply_fsdp`), so compile also applies on the
    single-GPU / replicate-only path.

    Wraps with ``torch.compile(module)`` and re-registers the resulting ``OptimizedModule``,
    matching ``parallelize_unified_mot.apply_compile`` — the repeated block compiles once and
    the artifact is reused across all layers.

    Runs AFTER :func:`apply_ac` and on whatever that returned, so under activation
    checkpointing the compiled unit is the ``CheckpointWrapper`` and the ``checkpoint`` call
    lands INSIDE the traced region — the arrangement Dynamo supports, where it becomes the
    activation-checkpoint higher-order op. Compiling the inner block instead would put
    compile inside the checkpoint and reintroduce the recomputed-metadata mismatch; see
    :func:`apply_ac`.

    Wrapping rather than the in-place ``nn.Module.compile`` keeps FSDP genuinely outside the
    compiled region. :func:`apply_fsdp` shards what this returns, so FSDP's forward hooks are
    registered on the ``OptimizedModule`` and run in eager AROUND the traced body. In-place
    ``.compile()`` sets ``_compiled_call_impl``, which wraps ``_call_impl`` — the function
    that RUNS those hooks — putting the collectives inside the traced callable and leaving
    correctness resting on ``torch._dynamo.config.skip_fsdp_hooks``.

    The ``_orig_mod`` rename this introduces (``...layers.N._orig_mod.*``) is handled
    everywhere it is observed, which is why the MoT path can afford the same wrapper:
    DCP's ``get_model_state_dict`` / ``set_model_state_dict`` skip the prefix for both model
    and optimizer state (``_get_fqns(..., skip_compiler_prefix=True)``), so save AND resume
    keys are unchanged by toggling compile; ``safetensors_loader`` and ``hf_export`` strip it
    explicitly; ``vlm_model._canonical_param_name`` strips it before freeze-config regexes
    are matched. ``tie_embeddings`` is unaffected because the tied ``lm_head`` /
    ``embed_tokens`` live at the root, not inside a repeated block.

    Applied BEFORE ``fully_shard`` (called first in :func:`parallelize`): FSDP2
    ``fully_shard`` SWAPS each block's ``__class__`` to a dynamically-created

    """Optimize an HFModel in place: activation checkpointing, ``torch.compile``, FSDP2.

    Mirrors ``parallelize_unified_mot.parallelize``, including its pass ORDER, which is
    load-bearing rather than incidental:

    1. :func:`apply_ac` collects the repeated blocks while their original type names are
       intact and swaps each for a ``CheckpointWrapper``.
    2. :func:`apply_compile` wraps those in ``torch.compile``, so the ``checkpoint`` call
       sits inside the compiled region (the arrangement Dynamo can lower to the AC
       higher-order op) rather than around it.
    3. :func:`apply_fsdp` shards the outermost wrapper, leaving FSDP's collective hooks
       outside both the compiled region and the checkpoint.

    Each pass hands the next the block slots it produced, so every pass wraps the artifact of
    the previous one and FSDP ends up outermost.

    Each pass is a no-op when its feature is disabled (AC when ``mode == "none"``, compile
    when ``compile_config`` is ``None``/disabled, FSDP when dp is off entirely), so this is
    safe to call on the single-GPU path — where it is in fact the only thing that enables
    activation checkpointing. The one unconditional failure is :func:`apply_ac` raising when
    the model exposes no repeated blocks, whatever the AC mode, since all three passes key off
    that same ``_no_split_modules`` declaration.

    Args:
        model:                    HFModel instance (``model`` attribute on meta or CPU
                                  device).

                                  :meth:`ParallelDims.build_meshes`.
        parallelism_config:       Source of the FSDP master and gradient-reduction dtypes
                                  (``fsdp_master_dtype``, and ``fsdp_reduce_dtype``
                                  falling back to it).
        precision:                FSDP MixedPrecisionPolicy parameter dtype.
        activation_checkpointing: AC policy (mode, ``save_ops_regex``,
                                  ``preserve_rng_state``, ``determinism_check``).
