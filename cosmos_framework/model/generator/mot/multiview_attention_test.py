"""Which multiview attention a config and a host resolve to between them.

The decision is a config-level one taken once per run, so these are CPU tests: the only thing
the device is consulted for is whether FA4 is usable, and a CPU device stands in for any host
where it is not. What each backend then computes is covered by ``flex_attention_test`` for the
mask and ``attention_test`` for the folds.
