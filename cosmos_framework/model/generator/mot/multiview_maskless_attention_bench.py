"""Time the maskless multiview folds against the paths they are an alternative to.

Three ways to attend one multiview sample, all timed over the same packed batch and all
including the reasoner's own causal self-attention, since every one of them runs it:

* ``dense_full`` -- ``two_way_attention`` with no mask, i.e. every GEN token attends to its
  whole sample. What a multiview run does today with FlexAttention off, and the cost both
  decompositions exist to beat.
* ``flex_decomposed`` -- ``multiview_attention`` under the multiview block mask at
  ``attention_scope="decomposed"``: one masked kernel over the fused ``[UND | GEN]`` stream.
* ``multiview_maskless`` -- ``multiview_attention`` under a ``MultiviewMasklessPlan``: three
  unmasked kernels (same
  view, cross view, gen->und) merged by log-sum-exp, no ``BlockMask`` anywhere.

``mask_build`` times the block mask the flex row needs. It is charged separately because
production builds it once per forward, outside the decoder layers, and every layer then
shares it -- so its per-layer share is that cost over ``--num-layers``, which the projection
line reports.

The two decompositions do not attend the same pairs, and the ``pairs`` column says so: the
maskless one takes the query's own ``(view, frame)`` cell twice, once from each of its two
sensor passes, where the mask takes it once. That is ``spatial_tokens`` extra keys per query
-- one cell out of the ``F + V - 1`` the scope admits -- and it is the deliberate
approximation documented on ``multiview_maskless_attention``, not a benchmarking artifact.
TFLOP/s is therefore each row's own useful work over its own time; the ``vs dense`` column is
what a caller actually chooses between.

Inference only: the maskless folds refuse grad, so every row is timed under
``torch.no_grad`` and the flex and dense rows are timed the same way rather than in the
training forward ``flex_attention_bench`` measures.

Example:

    PYTHONPATH=. python -m cosmos_framework.model.generator.mot.multiview_maskless_attention_bench \
        --num-views 7 --pixel-frames-per-view 29 61 121
