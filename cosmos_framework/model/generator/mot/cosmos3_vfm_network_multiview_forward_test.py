"""``Cosmos3VFMNetwork.forward`` over a real multiview pack, down both attention routes.

The branch this covers decides, per batch, whether the multiview GEN attention runs as the
FlexAttention mask or as ``multiview_maskless_attention``'s three merged passes. Its two
halves are each unit-tested -- ``_multiview_maskless_geometry`` for the decision and
``dispatch_attention`` for the routing -- but nothing joined them: the geometry the network
reads off a ``PackedSequence`` had never been handed to the attention function that folds by
it. A test built on hand-written packs cannot join them either, since the thing at risk is
exactly whether the packer's own layout and that geometry agree.

So the pack here comes from ``pack_input_sequence``, the entry the training and inference
paths both pack through, and the forward is the network's own. What is stubbed is the
reasoner: ``_StubLanguageModel`` stands in for the Qwen3-VL backbone, whose weights are an
S3 download and whose depth the attention routing does not turn on. It still runs the real
``dispatch_attention`` over the real pack, so the geometry is exercised against the kernels
rather than merely recorded, and it keeps the ``SplitInfo`` it was handed so the tests can
assert which route was taken rather than infer it from the numbers.
