"""FlexAttention implementation of the generation tower's attention.

``two_way_attention`` (see ``attention.py``) computes the generator's attention over
every token of its own sample -- the UND (understanding / caption) tokens and the GEN
tokens together. Its dense path does that in one kernel because "attend to the whole
sample" is plain block-diagonal, which flash can express. The multiview supertoken
rules restrict the GEN->GEN quadrant only, and the resulting combined mask is no
longer block-diagonal, so this module expresses it as a single FlexAttention call over
the concatenated ``[UND | GEN]`` key/value stream.

One fused call rather than two merged ones is deliberate. Splitting the quadrants into
separate kernels and recombining them with ``merge_attentions`` gives an identical
forward, but NATTEN's merge repairs the backward by writing the merged ``(out, lse)``
back into the buffers the attention kernel saved, and the heads-last conversion below
copies those buffers, so the repair silently misses and the GEN branch backpropagates
against its local softmax normalization. Fusing needs no LSE, no merge, and no such
contract; ``flex_attention_test`` checks the fused gradients against a dense reference.

This runs in three explicit phases:

1. :class:`FlexMetadata` holds the per-token fields (packed ``sample_id``, plus the
   multiview supertoken fields ``frame_id`` / ``view_id`` / ``is_noisy`` /
   ``is_control``), covering the ``[UND | GEN]`` key stream;
   :func:`build_multiview_flex_metadata` derives them from a packed batch.
2. :func:`build_block_mask` derives the ``BlockMask`` from that metadata, once per
   forward and outside the decoder layers. The mask is rectangular: GEN tokens are
   the queries, ``[UND | GEN]`` the keys.
3. :func:`flex_attention` runs the attention with that mask.

The ``BlockMask`` is the only artifact the attention path carries. The per-token
fields exist solely to define the ``mask_mod``, so a caller that just wants the mask
for a packed multiview batch should use :func:`build_multiview_block_mask`, which
runs phases 1 and 2 and returns the mask alone.

Which kernels this lowers onto is :func:`resolve_flex_backend`'s answer, taken once per
forward: FlashAttention-4 where it is installed and supported, FlexAttention's Triton
kernels otherwise (``flex_attention.backend`` in the model config pins either). The FA4
mask has to be built at :func:`flash_backend_block_size` and its streams padded to that
coarser query block, so the returned :class:`FlexBackend` carries the block size and the
padding multiple alongside the kernel options rather than leaving the three to be matched
up by hand. ``flex_attention_bench`` times both backends and documents the install.

:func:`flex_attention` always runs as a complete attention with no log-sum-exp request:
it has nothing to merge with another attention term, and the FlashAttention-4 backward
refuses to differentiate through one anyway.

The supertoken rules :func:`build_block_mask` enforces, all within a sample: every non-control
sensor token reaches every non-control sensor token within whatever view footprint
``attention_scope`` admits (every view by default). Control tokens -- a WSM (World Scenario
Map) video or LiDAR control stream, say -- are a separate modality read off ``is_control``:
sensor tokens reach them at their own view only, and control tokens reach each other at their
own view only. Optionally, a control query can also reach every non-control sensor key of its
own view, across all frames and noise states. Every GEN token, conditioning or noisy, attends
to every UND token of its own sample, as the dense gen->und pass does. See
:func:`_multiview_pair_predicate` for the rules themselves; richer patterns mean more metadata
fields and a longer ``mask_mod``, not new varlen bookkeeping.

@dataclass
class FlexMetadata:
    """Per-key-token metadata that drives the flex block mask.

    Each field is a 1-D ``[seq_len]`` tensor covering the key/value stream the mask
    spans, in packed token order. All are ``int64`` except ``is_noisy`` and ``is_control``,
    which are ``bool``. Padding positions carry the sentinel ``-1`` (``False`` for the two
    bool fields) so real queries never attend to padding and padded queries attend only to
    padding (no empty-softmax NaN).

    The key stream is the concatenation ``[UND | GEN]``: ``num_und`` block-padded
    understanding tokens followed by the block-padded GEN tokens. The GEN tokens are
    also the queries, so the mask this drives is rectangular -- ``q_len`` rows,
    ``seq_len`` columns -- and query index ``i`` is key index ``i + num_und``. Leaving
    ``num_und`` at 0 describes a GEN-only stream and yields the square GEN self-attention
    mask, which is what the metadata unit tests exercise.

    All tensor fields are required. They describe the multiview supertoken layout and
    drive the ``mask_mod`` in :func:`build_block_mask`:

    * ``sample_id``: packed sample index per token; yields the block-diagonal
      same-sample constraint every rule requires. UND tokens carry the sample they
      belong to, which is the only field their rule reads.
    * ``frame_id``: per-token frame index; ``-1`` on UND tokens, which have no place in the
      camera grid.
    * ``view_id``: which camera view a token belongs to, and -- on a UND token -- which camera
      view its caption *describes*. The two readings share one column because the streams are
      disjoint: a GEN token is always a token of some view, a UND token is always text about
      one. ``-1`` marks a token no view owns: padding, and a sample-level caption (the single
      caption a batch without ``separate_view_text_tokenization`` packs, describing the whole
      rig). A ``-1`` UND key is reachable from every view, so a stream of them reproduces the
      unrestricted gen->und pass exactly.

      Only the gen->und rule reads the UND half. The sensor rules exclude UND keys outright
      and the control rules require ``is_control``, which no UND token carries -- see
      :func:`_multiview_pair_predicate`, which is where that separation is kept.
    * ``is_noisy``: ``bool`` tensor, ``True`` for noisy sensor tokens and
      ``False`` for conditioning tokens (and for UND tokens).
    * ``is_control``: ``bool`` tensor, ``True`` for tokens of a control item (e.g. a WSM --
      World Scenario Map -- control video), ``False`` for every other token (sensor and UND
      alike). It carries no per-item identity, so control tokens sharing a view read as one
      signal; since the control rules only ever pair within a view, that costs nothing as
      long as a view holds a single control stream, which is the caller's to arrange (see
      ``SensorMaskItem.is_control``). An ordinary T2V/I2V/V2V batch marks no control item, carries
      it all-``False``, and drops every control term out of the predicate on its own.
    * ``timestamp``: ``float`` tensor, the wall-clock instant (in seconds, relative to
      whatever origin the caller's items share) a token's ``(view, frame)`` cell was
      captured at; ``-1.0`` on UND tokens and on padding, matching the other fields'
      sentinel. Read only by the ``"decomposed"`` scope's temporal half, and only when
      ``decomposed_temporal_window_seconds`` is set -- see :func:`_multiview_pair_predicate`.
      A token's timestamp is a function of its ``(view_id, frame_id)`` alone (one view's
      frames tick at one rate), which is what lets :func:`_metadata_groups` keep grouping on
      the integer fields without this one: two tokens sharing a run already share their
      timestamp.

    * ``caption_scope``: ``int64`` tensor, which of its sample's captions a GEN token reads:
      ``CAPTION_SCOPE_ALL`` (every one of them), ``CAPTION_SCOPE_SAME_VIEW`` (only the one
      written for its own view) or ``CAPTION_SCOPE_NONE`` (none at all). The whole of the
      gen->und rule reads this and nothing else on the query side.

      It is the resolution of :attr:`SensorMaskItem.caption_access` against the batch's caption
      layout, done in :func:`build_multiview_flex_metadata`: a camera is ``SAME_VIEW`` where the
      batch packs one caption per view and ``ALL`` where it packs a single sample-level one,
      since there the one caption describes the whole rig. A LiDAR sweep is ``ALL`` or ``NONE``
      by config, in either layout. Read only on the **query** side, so the UND prefix and the
      padding carry ``ALL``: neither is ever a real query, and the permissive value leaves the
      padding reaching the padding it already reached.

    The mask enforces, within a sample:

    * GEN Q -> UND K: as ``caption_scope`` says -- every UND token of the sample, only the
      one whose ``view_id`` matches the query's, or none at all (the gen->und pass);
    * sensor Q -> sensor K: within whatever ``AttentionScope`` admits (every view, its own
      view, or -- ``"decomposed"`` -- its own view or its own frame, or -- with
      ``decomposed_temporal_window_seconds`` set -- its own view or a key within that many
      seconds of it, at or before it), regardless of whether either token is conditioning;
    * sensor Q (conditioning or noisy) -> control K: same view, any frame;
    * control Q -> control K: same view, any frame;
    * control Q -> non-control sensor K: same view, any frame and noise state, only when
      ``control_attends_sensor`` is enabled. This applies equally to camera and LiDAR streams.

    :func:`_multiview_pair_predicate` is where those rules are actually expressed, so it is
    the one to trust if this list and it ever drift apart.

    ``attention_scope`` is a choice rather than a description of the batch; it rides here
    so that the two places the predicate is built from -- the ``mask_mod`` the kernel
    calls and the block-level collapsing in :func:`build_block_mask` -- cannot be given
    different answers: a block the collapsing calls fully unmasked is one the kernel never
    calls ``mask_mod`` on at all, so the two disagreeing would not raise, it would silently
    attend across views.

    This type is an intermediate: :func:`build_block_mask` folds it into a
    :class:`BlockMask` and only that mask travels on to
    :func:`flex_attention`. The tensors themselves stay reachable through the
    mask's ``mask_mod`` closure, which the kernel evaluates on partially-masked
    blocks, so nothing here can be freed early.

    Every field is required. None of them has a default, deliberately: a default here is a
    silently narrower or wider mask, which is the one failure this type cannot surface --
    ``attention_scope`` and ``control_attends_sensor`` change what a token may attend, and
    and ``caption_scope`` decides which of its sample's captions a token reads. A new
    construction site has to state each of them rather than inherit an answer, and the two
    that exist (:func:`build_multiview_flex_metadata` and the test builder) both do.

    positions on both sides. Passing the query fields on the left instead gives the
    ``mask_mod`` FlexAttention itself calls -- see :func:`_multiview_mask_mod`.

    All rules are gated on ``same_sample`` (block-diagonal packing). On top of
    that, using the per-token frame/view/modality metadata:

    * a GEN Q attends the UND K of its sample as its ``caption_scope`` says: all of them
      (``CAPTION_SCOPE_ALL``), only the one written for its own view (``SAME_VIEW``, matched
      by ``same_view`` against the key's ``view_id``), or none at all (``NONE``, a LiDAR stream
      under ``lidar_attends_captions=False``) -- the gen->und pass. The key's ``view_id`` is
      consulted in the ``SAME_VIEW`` arm alone; the layout question it used to answer -- that a
      single sample-level caption is reachable from every view -- is settled when the scope is
      resolved, see :func:`build_multiview_flex_metadata`;
    * every sensor Q attends every sensor K within whatever ``attention_scope`` admits
      (every view, its own view, or -- ``"decomposed"`` -- its own view or its own frame /
      temporal window), regardless of whether either token is conditioning;
    * sensor Q (conditioning or noisy alike) attends every control K of its **own view**, any
      frame;
    * control Q attends every control K of its **own view**, any frame;
    * when ``control_attends_sensor`` is enabled, a control Q also attends every non-control
      sensor K of its **own view**, at any frame and noise state. Camera and LiDAR streams use
      the same rule; their disjoint view offsets prevent cross-sensor pairs.

    Every control rule here is a view rule rather than a ``(frame, view)`` rule: every
    scope gives a query its own view at *any* frame, which makes ``"same_view"`` a clip's
    own attention rather than a set of stills. Frames are free at the block level
    because :func:`_metadata_groups` already splits its runs per ``(item, frame, view)``
    cell, so the coarse predicate tells views and frames apart without a finer grouping.

    ``"decomposed"``'s temporal half is, by default, "the query's own frame index" --
    ``same_frame``, which only means the same instant when every sensor shares one clock.
    ``decomposed_temporal_window_seconds`` replaces that with a real-time comparison instead:
    a key is in the query's temporal reach when ``0 <= q_timestamp - k_timestamp <=
    decomposed_temporal_window_seconds`` (both bounds widened by a small float32 tolerance, since
    ``timestamp`` is computed from ``frame_id * seconds_per_frame`` and a pair meant to land
    exactly on a boundary can round a hair past it), i.e. the key was captured at or before the
    query, within that many seconds -- what lets a 7.5 Hz camera and a 10 Hz LiDAR sweep register
    against each other by real capture time rather than by a frame index neither shares. Left
    ``None``, the scope keeps its original same-frame-index meaning.

    A batch with no control item carries ``is_control`` all-``False``, which drops all
    control terms on its own -- see :class:`FlexMetadata`.

    ``gen_to_und`` is the sole term admitting a UND key, and the other rules say so explicitly:
    ``sensor_to_sensor`` and ``control_to_sensor`` carry ``~k_und``, while ``sensor_to_control``
    and ``control_to_control`` require ``k_control``, which no UND token carries. That is
    load-bearing rather than tidiness. ``view_id`` on a UND token names the view its caption
    describes (see :class:`FlexMetadata`), so ``same_view`` matches a caption against the camera
    it was written for -- which is exactly what ``gen_to_und`` wants and exactly what the other
    rules must not act on. Under ``"all_views"`` ``reaches_every_view`` alone satisfies
    ``in_scope``, so without ``~k_und`` a per-view caption would come in through
    ``sensor_to_sensor`` and reach every view no matter what ``gen_to_und`` says.

    Padding carries ``-1`` in every id field, so real queries never see it and padded queries
    attend only to padding. The packer keeps at least one padded row on each stream once
    either is padded, so a padded query always has a padded key to attend to.

    This closure ends up inside the :class:`BlockMask` and is therefore the one Inductor

    offset zero. The obvious alternative -- keep the key-stream predicate and shift the row

    and the FlashAttention-4 backend rejects the whole graph for it, because a captured scalar
    goes dynamic as soon as the enclosing region is compiled with dynamic shapes and CuteDSL
    cannot inline a symbolic value into its template. Slicing the fields per side does not get
    rid of that scalar either -- it moves it into the slice's storage offset, which goes
    dynamic just the same, hence the copy in :meth:`_StreamFields.tail`.

    Symbolically *shaped* fields are fine: a training run holds one graph over a hundred

class SensorMaskItem:
    """One latent clip of one generation stream, as the multiview mask sees it.

    An item is a camera clip, a LiDAR range clip, or a control stream conditioning one of
    those. It contributes ``latent_t * patch_h * patch_w`` tokens laid out view-outer,
    frame-inner, spatial-innermost -- the camera-major order the multiview dataset
    concatenates its per-camera clips in.

    The per-item invariants are checked here, at construction, rather than by the builder
    that consumes a batch of these: an item whose latent axis does not divide into its
    views, or whose condition mask does not cover that axis, is malformed on its own terms,
    and catching it here names the one item rather than an index into a flattened list.

    Every field is required. None of them has a default, for the reason :class:`FlexMetadata`
    states of its own: each one changes what the mask admits, and a silently narrower or wider
    mask is the one failure this type cannot surface. ``num_views`` and ``view_offset`` place
    the item on the view grid every rule compares in, ``is_control`` moves it between two sets
    of rules, ``caption_access`` decides which captions it reads, and ``seconds_per_frame`` is
    what the windowed form of ``"decomposed"`` compares -- a default of ``1.0`` there is a
    sensor silently declared to tick once a second, which is wrong for every real one and only
    harmless while nothing reads it. A caller states the item it means.

    Attributes:
        token_shape: ``(latent_t, patch_h, patch_w)``, where ``latent_t = num_views *
            frames_per_view`` counts the camera-major latent axis.
        condition_mask: ``[latent_t]`` over that same axis, a non-zero entry marking a
            conditioning (clean) frame -- what ``SequencePacker.pack_vision_tokens``
            appends to ``vision.condition_mask``. Any shape whose element count is
            ``latent_t`` will do; the builder reshapes it.
        num_views: cameras this item covers.
        view_offset: where its views start on its sample's view axis. Items on disjoint
            offsets are paired by no rule at all, which is what keeps a second sensor's
            clips off the camera rig's views -- see :func:`build_multiview_flex_metadata`.
        is_control: whether this is a control stream rather than a target conditioning on
            one. The mask confines a control item to its own view and keeps it out of the
            sensor rules entirely -- see :func:`_multiview_pair_predicate`.
        seconds_per_frame: real-world time between two consecutive latent frames of one of
            this item's cameras, i.e. the inverse of that sensor's latent frame rate. Only
            read to build :attr:`FlexMetadata.timestamp`, which only the ``"decomposed"``
            scope's ``decomposed_temporal_window_seconds`` form consults -- every other rule
            and the plain ``"decomposed"`` form compare ``frame_id`` directly.
        caption_access: what this item is to its sample's captions, stated without reference to
            how many of them there are -- see ``CaptionAccess``. ``"camera"`` is one of the
            rig's cameras: it reads the caption written for its view, or the sample's single
            caption where that is all there is, which :func:`build_multiview_flex_metadata`
            resolves against the layout. ``"all_captions"`` is a LiDAR sweep, which fuses the
            whole rig and so reads every caption; a sweep under
            ``lidar_attends_captions=False`` is ``"no_captions"`` and reads none, denoising
            against the other sensors and its control stream alone. This is also what says
            which views a per-view caption layout has to cover: the cameras' and no others,

        causal_offsets: cumulative per-sample UND offsets, ``[num_samples + 1]``;

            predicate. Never widens a control token's reach, which is always its own view.
            ``"decomposed"`` is rejected once more than one view offset is in play and
            ``decomposed_temporal_window_seconds`` is ``None``, because that combination pairs
            across views by frame index and a second sensor does not share the camera's frame
            index -- 7.5 Hz camera latents against 10 Hz sweeps. Passing a window lifts that
            restriction: the temporal half then compares real capture time instead, which is
            defined across sensors.
        decomposed_temporal_window_seconds: with ``attention_scope="decomposed"``, replaces
            "the query's own frame index" with "any key within this many seconds at or before
            the query's real capture time" for the scope's temporal half -- see
            :func:`_multiview_pair_predicate`. ``None`` (the default) keeps the frame-index
            form, which is also the only form :class:`SensorMaskItem`'s default
            ``seconds_per_frame=1.0`` produces the same answer for. Ignored outside
            ``"decomposed"``.
        control_attends_sensor: whether a control query may attend to every non-control sensor
            key in its own view, across all frames and noise states. False preserves the existing
            one-way sensor-to-control connectivity. Applies equally to camera and LiDAR streams.
        sensor_mask_items: the items each sample owns, in packed order. See
            :class:`SensorMaskItem` for what one describes and which of its fields the mask
            rules read.
        caption_mask_items: the captions each sample's UND stream carries, in packed order,
            each naming the camera view it describes -- see :class:`CaptionMaskItem`. ``None`` (the
            default) labels every UND token ``-1``, i.e. one caption for the whole rig,
            reachable from every view, which is the layout a batch without
            ``separate_view_text_tokenization`` packs and leaves the gen->und pass exactly as
            unrestricted as it was. Supplying it requires a UND stream (``und_seq_len`` non-zero),
            and each sample's captions must cover its camera views exactly once; see
            :func:`_build_und_view_ids`.
        device: device for the returned tensors.

    Returns:
        :class:`FlexMetadata` whose per-token fields are each ``[und_seq_len + gen_seq_len]``: the
        UND tokens (sample ids only, ``-1`` / ``False`` in every multiview field), then the
        real GEN tokens in packed order, each stream followed by ``-1`` / ``-1.0`` sentinels
        (``False`` for ``is_noisy`` and ``is_control``) across its trailing pad.

    """Build the GEN-tower :class:`BlockMask` from precomputed flex metadata.

    Uses the multiview supertoken ``mask_mod``; the multiview fields
    (``frame_id`` / ``view_id`` / ``is_noisy`` / ``is_control``) must be populated on
    ``metadata``.

    ``create_block_mask`` is deliberately not used here. It evaluates the predicate
    into a dense ``[Q_LEN, KV_LEN]`` bool tensor before reducing it to blocks, and
    Inductor does not fuse that intermediate away for this ``mask_mod``, so the build
    costs one byte per token pair: 24 GiB at 162k tokens and 98 GiB at 324k, which is
    where 11 cameras at 720p land.

    Instead the predicate is collapsed onto the ``G`` runs of equal metadata
    (:func:`_metadata_groups`), which for a multiview pack is one run per
    ``(item, frame, view)`` cell -- a few hundred, against hundreds of thousands of
    tokens. ``allowed [G, G]`` is the predicate at that granularity, ``presence
    [num_blocks, G]`` marks which runs each block of tokens touches, and the two
    matmuls below count, for every block pair, the allowed and the blocked run pairs
    it spans. A block pair is fully unmasked when it spans no blocked pair and
    partially masked when it spans at least one of each. Both matmuls accumulate
    non-negative terms and are only ever compared against zero, so the counts do not
    have to be exactly representable for the comparisons to be exact.

    That makes the build ``O(num_q_blocks * num_kv_blocks * G)`` in time and
    ``O(num_q_blocks * num_kv_blocks)`` in memory, versus ``O(seq_len**2)`` for both
    before.

    Call this from outside the decoder layers and hand the returned mask to the
    attention path: the group count is data-dependent, so materializing it syncs with
    the host, which Dynamo cannot trace inside a compiled, activation-checkpointed
    layer. Building it once per forward also avoids rebuilding the identical mask in
    every layer.
