"""Benchmark the multiview FlexAttention mask over the fused ``[UND | GEN]`` key stream.

Measures the costs that ``cosmos3_vfm_network`` pays when ``flex_attention.enabled`` is
on, for a packed multiview batch:

1. ``mask_build`` -- ``build_multiview_block_mask``, paid **once per step**
   (outside the decoder layers, shared by all of them);
2. ``flex_fwd`` / ``flex_fwd_bwd`` -- ``flex_attention``, paid **once per
   decoder layer**;
3. ``flash_fwd`` / ``flash_fwd_bwd`` plus ``mask_build_flash`` -- the same two
   costs on FlexAttention's FlashAttention-4 backend, with ``--flash`` (see below);
4. ``dense_fwd`` / ``dense_fwd_bwd`` -- the varlen baseline it replaces, i.e. every
   GEN token attending to every token of its own sample, causal (understanding) tokens
   included. This is the reference point for the speedup: FlexAttention computes a
   strict subset of those pairs.

Both sides run the shape ``two_way_attention``'s full pass runs: GEN tokens query the
concatenated ``[UND | GEN]`` stream, so the attention is rectangular and the causal
tokens are keys that every GEN token of the same sample reaches. ``--num-causal-tokens``
sets how many of them each sample carries (the caption/reasoner prefix; 301 by default),
and the stream is padded to a key-block multiple exactly as the packer's
``causal_seq_alignment`` does, so the UND/GEN boundary lands on a block boundary and the
gen->und quadrant keeps the fully-unmasked fast path.

The restriction the multiview mask expresses is confined to the GEN->GEN quadrant, so
that quadrant is the whole of the speedup: gen->und is dense for flex and dense alike.
At the default sizes it is also a few hundred keys against 161,920, so passing
``--num-causal-tokens 0`` (the pure GEN->GEN benchmark) barely moves either number --
what the causal prefix mostly buys is that the shape being timed is the shape a step
runs, padding blocks included.

Default scenario (the one this script was written for): 11 cameras at 720p, one
fully-conditioning camera item (the control/clean stream, positionally first) plus
one noisy camera item (the video being generated, positionally last -- the RGB
target), both on the same ``(view, frame)`` grid. That is the transfer layout the
mask was designed for, so the mask keeps

* noisy (RGB) -> RGB: what ``--attention-scopes`` admits, by default the full square
  within the sample (the dominant term), reaching conditioning and noisy RGB keys
  alike,
* conditioning (RGB) -> conditioning (RGB): the same ``--attention-scopes`` reach,
  confined to conditioning keys,
* RGB (either) -> control: own view, any frame, unconditional on ``attention_scope``,
* control -> control: the same own-view-any-frame reach, among control items only,
* conditioning (RGB) -> noisy (RGB), or control -> RGB in either direction: never.

Attention scopes (``--attention-scopes``)
------------------------------------------

The noisy square above is the largest quadrant of the mask, so the ``attention_scope``
config knob -- which restricts it to the query's own camera (``same_view``) or to its own
camera and its own instant (``decomposed``) -- is the one mask choice that changes
what a step costs rather than only what it may look at. Passing several scopes runs the whole
benchmark once per scope over the identical pack and adds a comparison table of what each one
bought, against the first scope listed:

* ``pairs`` is the ratio of allowed token pairs, i.e. the speedup a mask whose rules landed on
  block boundaries would give: ``V`` for ``same_view``, ``V*F / (F + V - 1)`` for
  ``decomposed`` over the noisy square, diluted by the quadrants the scope leaves
  alone;
* ``blocks`` is the ratio of *visited blocks*, i.e. what this mask at this block size actually
  leaves the kernel free to skip, and therefore the ratio to read the wall clock against. It
  trails ``pairs`` by whatever the scope's boundaries cost in partially-masked blocks, which
  are charged in full: ``same_view`` keeps nearly all of its saving, since a camera's tokens
  are one contiguous run of the camera-major layout, while ``decomposed`` gives more
  of it back, since its same-frame stripes are single ``(frame, view)`` cells (920 tokens at
  the default geometry, against 128- or 256-token blocks) and each stripe pays a partial block
  at both ends;
* ``measured`` is the wall clock, and tracking the ``blocks`` column is the property being
  checked. Falling well short of it says the row is no longer attention-bound at that size,
  not that the mask failed to narrow; coming in below ``1.00x`` says the narrower mask did not
  get sparser, which at these sizes should not happen.

Token geometry follows the multiview AV configs: the Wan2.2 tokenizer's 16x spatial and 4x
temporal compression, and ``patch_spatial=2`` from the diffusion expert. A 720x1280 frame
therefore becomes a 45x80 latent, patchified to 23x40 = 920 tokens, and ``F`` pixel frames
per camera become ``1 + (F - 1) // 4`` latent frames. Both factors stay overridable for
other tokenizers, e.g. ``--latent-downsample-factor 8`` for the Wan2.1 4x8x8 VAE. With 11
cameras, 29 pixel frames each and two items that is 2 * 11 * 8 * 920 = 161,920 GEN tokens
in one sample, which the 301 causal tokens extend to 162,304 keys once block-padded to 384
-- so the dense baseline is a 161,920 x 162,304 attention and the numbers below are large
by construction.

Each timed row reports achieved TFLOP/s and the matching MFU, i.e. that throughput
over the device's dense BF16 peak (auto-detected, or set with ``--peak-tflops``).
This is the utilization of *this one operator*, not model MFU: the numerator counts
only the attention matmuls of this one pass, so it says how well the kernel uses the
machine on the work it does, not how much of a training step is useful math.

Three caveats when reading the output. The FlexAttention kernel skips whole blocks, so
its cost -- and hence its TFLOP/s and MFU -- tracks the *visited block* fraction rather
than the (lower) fraction of allowed token pairs; both are reported, per backend, since
the two use different block sizes.

Nor are visited blocks all alike, which is why each mask reports its grid as full, partial
and empty blocks: the empty ones are the computation the mask removes, and the split between
the other two is what the removal cost. A partial block is charged one full tile of math by
the FLOP count above but costs more than a full one to run, because the ``mask_mod`` is
evaluated over every position in it and the unmasked fast path is gone -- twice over in the
backward, which evaluates the mask in both of its passes. So a mask with a high partial
share posts a lower MFU at the same visited-block count, and a narrower
``attention_scope`` can be genuinely faster while reporting *worse* utilization: it
gets there by turning full blocks into partial ones.

And ``mask_build`` evaluates the ``mask_mod`` over every block pair, so at these sequence
lengths it is not free; it does no attention math, so it has no TFLOP/s or MFU and the
report instead amortizes it over ``--num-layers``.

FlashAttention-4 backend (``--flash``)
--------------------------------------

FlexAttention can lower onto FlashAttention-4 (CuTeDSL) instead of its Triton kernels on
Hopper and Blackwell, via ``kernel_options={"BACKEND": "FLASH"}``. Install the kernels
into the training container with::

    pip install --pre "flash-attn-4[cu13]"   # CUDA 12.x: drop the [cu13] extra

FA4 publishes only pre-releases so far (4.0.0bN), and its ``nvidia-cutlass-dsl`` pin is a
``.dev`` build, so ``--pre`` is required for the resolve to find either.

That pulls ``nvidia-cutlass-dsl`` and JIT-compiles at runtime, so there is no build step,
but it does need a torch new enough to carry the Inductor CuTeDSL codegen (a recent
nightly at the time of writing); on an older torch the ``BACKEND`` kernel option is
rejected and the ``flash_*`` rows report that in the status column rather than failing
the sweep.

Once those hold, a training run picks the backend up on its own:
``flex_attention.resolve_flex_backend`` answers the same question the ``--flash`` rows
assume the answer to, and ``flex_attention.backend="auto"`` (the default) takes it. This
sweep stays explicit because its job is to compare the two, not to run the faster one.

Two things make the flash rows more than a kernel_options flip:

* Block size. FA4 drives its tile scheduler from the block mask, and on Blackwell each
  CTA owns two query tiles (``q_stage=2``), so the smallest region it can skip is 256x128
  rather than the Triton path's 128x128 (Hopper keeps 128x128). The flash rows therefore
  run against their own, coarser mask -- hence the separate ``mask_build_flash`` row and
  the separate visited-block percentage -- and the padded GEN length is raised to that Q
  block so both backends attend over exactly the same tokens.
* Coarser blocks visit more token pairs for the same mask, so a like-for-like read of the
  two backends is the wall-clock (``median(ms)``) columns; their TFLOP/s are each scored
  against the work that backend actually does.

No row requests the log-sum-exp, which is what keeps FA4 in scope at all. ``two_way_attention``
fuses the gen->und keys into this same call rather than merging a second attention term into
it, so a step never asks for the LSE; and the FA4 backward has no rule for differentiating it,
refusing to lower a backward graph that carries a tangent for it -- which asking for the LSE
creates whether or not anything downstream uses it (this benchmark's loss is ``out.sum()``, so
the tangent is zeros, and it still fails). What the rows time is therefore what a step pays.

Two further FA4 limitations, neither of which this mask trips: the backward is not
deterministic when block-sparsity is on, and gradients for buffers captured by a
``score_mod``/``mask_mod`` are unsupported (this mask captures only integer metadata,
which needs no gradient).

    control, the ``num_noisy_items`` generated items are targets. Nothing is inferred from

    The ``dense_*`` offsets describe the same attention for the varlen baseline: GEN
    queries against their own sample's UND and GEN keys, which is what
    ``two_way_attention`` runs against ``get_all_seq`` when no mask is in play. Both
    streams carry trailing block padding, and varlen leaves rows outside its cumulative
    ranges unwritten in both directions, so the last sample's range is stretched to the
    end of each buffer. The alternative -- padding as its own segment, as the packer
    describes it -- needs a segment on both sides, and the two streams are padded
    independently, so it would mean handing a kernel a zero-length query segment. The

    The scope narrows the noisy->noisy quadrant and nothing else, and every scope runs the
    same pack, so the pairs it drops are the whole of the saving. Two ratios bound what a
    kernel can return for them, which is what the first table reports per scope:

    * ``pairs`` -- the allowed-pair ratio, i.e. the speedup a mask whose rules landed on block
      boundaries would give. An upper bound: a partially-masked block costs a full one.
    * ``blocks`` -- the visited-block ratio of the mask actually built, i.e. the work the
      kernel is left free to skip. Below ``pairs`` by what the scope's boundaries cost, which
      is little for ``same_view`` (one contiguous run per camera) and more for
      ``decomposed`` (a partial block at each end of every same-frame stripe).
    * ``skipped%`` -- the share of the mask's whole block grid that is empty, i.e. the
      computation the scope removes outright. Read with ``partial%`` it says how the narrowing
      landed: blocks the rules missed entirely (skipped, free) against blocks they cut through
      (partial, charged in full).
    * ``partial%`` -- the share of the visited blocks the rules cut through. It is the
      reason a narrow scope can be faster than the baseline and still post a *lower* MFU:
      narrowing converts full blocks into partial ones, which are charged the same tile of
      math by ``blocks`` and by the FLOP count but cost more to run, since the ``mask_mod``
      has to be evaluated over every position in them and the unmasked fast path is gone.
      The backward pays that per-block overhead again in each of its two passes, so its rows
      lose the most. A coarser block size raises this share for the same rules, which is why
      the flash column runs higher than the Triton one.

    The second table puts the wall clock next to the ``blocks`` bound, as ``of blocks``: a row
    near 100% converted the sparsity into time, which is the property worth checking. Well
    below it says the row is no longer attention-bound at this size (mask build, launch
    overhead, the backward's mask-independent traffic) or is paying for the partial blocks
    above, not that the mask failed to narrow -- and a ``measured`` under 1.00x says the
    narrower mask did not get sparser at all, which at these sizes should not happen.
