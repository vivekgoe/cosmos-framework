    Must run on every call (not once at compile time): each training step builds a brand new
    ``SequencePack`` with brand new tensor objects, and Dynamo's unbacked marking is stored as
    an attribute on the tensor object itself, not learned from previous calls.

    ``mark_unbacked`` makes the compiler report dim 0's size as "always not equal to zero or
    one" (see ``torch._dynamo.decorators.mark_unbacked``'s docstring) -- a hard-coded assumption,
    not a guess it falls back from. ``sequence_packing/runtime.py`` documents that this dimension
    *can* legitimately be 0 for some real batches (e.g. AR no-text packs carry full splits only,
    so their ``causal_seq`` is empty), so marking a genuinely 0/1-sized tensor here would violate
    that assumption and risk silently wrong compiled output instead of a guard failure. Skip those
    and let Dynamo fall back to its normal backed/specialized handling for that one call --
    correctness over avoiding an occasional recompile.

    Deliberately without ``strict=True``, despite how its docstring reads. ``strict`` does not
    strengthen the marking -- it replaces it. ``mark_unbacked`` returns early under ``strict``,
    recording the index in ``_dynamo_strict_unbacked_indices`` and never in
    ``_dynamo_unbacked_indices``, and only the latter selects ``DimDynamic.UNBACKED`` in
    ``_dynamo/variables/builder.py``. The dim instead falls through to ordinary automatic-dynamic
    and gets a *backed* symbol, which carries a hint -- and a hint is exactly what lets Inductor
    answer size questions in ``broadcast_symbolic_shapes`` and ``scheduler.can_fuse`` and install
    the guards whose failures caused the recompiles this marking exists to remove. What ``strict``
    does supply is a constraint that raises if the dim is *constant-folded*, which is a narrower
    event than being guarded on, so it never fired while the recompiles continued. Measured
    identically on torch 2.9 and 2.13: ``mark_unbacked(x, 0)`` yields ``u0``, ``strict=True``
    yields ``s77``.

    Consumers must therefore be data-dependent-friendly, since an unbacked dim has no value to
    settle a branch or a comparison with. Three kinds of site need care, all of them reached from
    the compiled block: a plain ``if`` on one of these lengths (use ``guard_or_true`` /
    ``guard_or_false``), an invariant the attention stack re-derives and guards on internally
    (state it with ``torch._check``), and an ``int()`` coercion, which demands a concrete value
    outright and has no friendly form; leave the length symbolic instead.

    A consumer that derives a *smaller* count from one of these lengths and uses it as a tensor
    dimension needs the 0/1 exclusion to shift with it, because PyTorch specializes the derived
    dim, not the one marked here: a size-1 derived dim is specialized to the constant 1, which
    pins the marked length to a constant too. ``sample_offsets`` is the one such key -- it carries
    ``N + 1`` offsets for ``N`` samples -- and its consumer,
    ``unified_mot._get_local_sample_ids``, avoids the whole situation by reading the pad-segment
    length instead, so no shifted exclusion is needed here.

    Marks unconditionally: whether a given call should mark at all is
    :func:`_wrap_forward_with_unbacked_pack`'s decision, since both of the conditions that answer it
    are properties of the call rather than of the pack.

    ``input`` is the block's own packed sequence; ``packed_position_embeddings`` is the
    ``(cos, sin)`` pair of packs describing RoPE embeddings over the same layout, so it varies in
    lockstep with ``input`` and needs the same treatment.

    Packs whose ``attention_mask`` carries a FlexAttention block mask are left alone, because that
    path cannot currently be compiled with unbacked lengths. The obstruction is not in this repo:
    the generator's full attention runs over a fused ``[UND | GEN]`` stream, whose outer stride is
    ``heads * head_dim * (u_und + u_gen)``, and Inductor's layout pass sorts strides through
    ``ir.get_fill_order``, which falls back to a plain ``sorted()`` whenever its caller passes no
    ShapeEnv. Comparing that stride against a constant inside ``sorted()`` raises
    ``GuardOnDataDependentSymNode`` from the middle of an Inductor pass. Nothing in this
    repo can annotate a comparison there: ``torch._check`` relates whole lengths, and the ShapeEnv
    does not substitute such a relation back into a stride expression already built from the
    individual terms.

    Marking is also confined to training via ``torch.is_grad_enabled``, on the same reasoning that
    gates ``attention._use_varlen``'s dense shortcut: the recompiles it removes come from batch
    composition varying between training steps, while inference holds its pack layout fixed across
    the denoising loop. Marking there buys nothing and breaks compilation outright, because an
    unbacked length used as a slice offset makes the resulting view's ``storage_offset``
    data-dependent -- ``heads * head_dim * u0`` for the heads-flattened attention output that
    ``o_proj`` consumes.

    Both conditions are tested here, per call, and neither can move to ``apply_compile`` beside
    ``CompileConfig.mark_unbacked``. That flag is read once at setup; these two are properties of
    the individual call. Grad state in particular flips within one process -- the periodic sampling
    callbacks drive these same compiled blocks under ``torch.no_grad`` -- so a setup-time reading
    would say "training" forever and mark straight through the first sampling callback.

        model: The unified MoT (typically ``omni_model.language_model``).
        parallel_dims: Device mesh / parallelism descriptor.
        compile_config: Compile switches (enabled, dynamic, autotune).
        ac_config: Selective activation-checkpointing policy. ``None`` falls
            back to the dataclass defaults (mode="selective", save the
            ``save_ops_regex`` ops, mode="full", save only the outputs of
            each transformer block).
        attention_io_layout: Tensor layout at the attention boundary under CP.
        mp_policy: FSDP2 mixed-precision policy, forwarded to :func:`apply_fsdp`.
            ``None`` keeps FSDP2's default of no casting.
